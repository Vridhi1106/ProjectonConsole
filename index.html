        Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.
        To start with visual studio code, first download the software. Then, create a folder on your desktop and open it here. Now, create a new file and start coding :).

      <h2 style="font-weight:700; color: navy"> What is a console? What is its use? How to open a console? How can we print text in console?</h2>
      <h4 style="color:deeppink; font-weight:600; font-size: 20px;">
        A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.
        It simplifies the learning process of a new programming language by removing the complexity of a graphical user interface.
        To open the console screen, right click and then click on inspect. Then, click on the console button next to the Elements button. There you can see all the codes printed in console.
        Text written in console can be printed by using a code console.log( ).

            var first_name="Ranbir";
            var last_name=" Kapoor";
            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);

            var power=Math.pow(10,2);
            console.log(power); var maximum=Math.max();

            console.log(minimum);
